# Minesweeper
Class Project where I implemented the Minesweeper interface using JavaFX. <br />

Below are screenshots of the game screens. <br />

This is the start screen of the game. The player must enter their name, choose a difficulty (easy, medium, or hard) and press the start button to begin. <br />

This is what the player sees at the start of the game. A GridPane is used to maintain the grid-like pattern of tiles. Each tile is a button that can be clicked. <br />

I pressed a tile (or button) and the corresponding tiles changed color and text based on the position of the tile I clicked. <br />

I clicked a lone square and lost. :( But the player can player again, which will redirect to the start screen. <br />
